# Capstone Portfolio

Portfolio for signature work for capstone class (University of St. Thomas)

This repository contains three projects that I completed during my time at the University of St. Thomas:

1. A personal website

2. An interactive web crime map 

3. Statistical analysis and write-up related to the Bechdel Test and movies

Both websites were created for a web development class, for the purpose of familiarizing myself with web development, APIs, and frameworks

The statistical analysis was done as part of a statistics class, as a demonstration of my ability to critically analyze data and validate statistical models.

Each project has its own README with more information. The Bechdel Test project has a full write-up available for reading in PDF format.

## Reflection

Through these projects, I familiarized myself with some of the skills required for a working profession in the computer science field. I became proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, various JS/CSS frameworks, and R. These projects were particularly interesting to me compared to the rest of my body of work as a student because I am able to see the output of my work and make a functional product that could be useful for a business. 

### The Bechdel Test Analysis
*For context, please see the README in the Bechdel Test folder*

My work on analyzing movie data in an attempt to predict whether or not a movie can pass the Bechdel Test was particularly valuable for me as a student. It helped me learn to think creatively about generating different variables from existing data that can be used for statistical analysis. Breaking down large text variables in order to track down patterns in data was vital for this project. I was very proud to find that my custom variables regarding pronouns in descriptions was statistically significant, even more than some of the basic variables we had. 

In addition to opening creating doors for me, it also helped me understand how my work could relate to outside fields of study. Admittedly, the Bechdel Test is a fun but not particularly important cultural standard. However, this type of statistical analysis could be repeated for countless other topics (eg. I did a similar project on diabetes prediction). Statistics is not my primary field of study, but I enjoyed being able to explore potentially important research using R.

In the future, I would love to continue exploring predictive statistical analysis in fields that could make a difference culturally.
