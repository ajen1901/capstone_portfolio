This project is an interactive map that displays crime statistics for the city of St. Paul, Minnesota. Our group designed both the website and the RESTful server that supplies the data. The website is a single page application and includes a map via the Nominatum API, neighborhood markers, filters for neighborhoods and crime types, and a table that displays relevant incidents. There is also an add/remove incident tab for submitting incidents to the database, and an about me tab which contains information about the authors and the frameworks/ apis used in the making of the project. To view the project, view this youtube video, which was created by one of the co-authors, Joe Schoen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRSP5AcqNtI

On this project, my primary role included the following:

1. Creation of the GET incidents functionality of the server

2. Creation of the filter system, both front and backend

3. Color-coding the table for different crime types.

* Please note: this repository does not include the original database, so it cannot be run as-is
