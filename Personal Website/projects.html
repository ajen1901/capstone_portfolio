                            For my first computer science course, my final assignment was to create a working model of Conway's Game of Life, a simulator that shows
                            cells in two different states, alive or dead, based on the last state of it's surrounding cells. A cell is set as alive if it was previously
                            alive and it has 2 or 3 live neighbors, or if the cell was previously dead and has exactly 3 live neighbors.

                            When I took Information Security, my final assignment was to create a site using an information grabbing technique designed to 
                            trick users into giving away some of their browser history using font colors. It works by showing un-clickable links, represented by random
                            letters, setting the previously clicked color to the background color of the site, and requesting that the user submit the letters that they see,
                            presented as a captcha.

                            When I worked at AWS, my project was to create various succinct cheatsheets for different data streaming services that AWS provides.
                            While this was technically an internal project, the information contained on the sheets is public knowledge. Regardless, I am not comfortable
                            showing the actual cheatsheets publicly, so I have displayed the template I used to create them instead.
