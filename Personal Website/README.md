# Personal Website

Author:

Audrey Jenkins

While learning web development, I created a personal website for myself. The website uses Foundations as its framework for its grid organizational structure.

The website has three primary pages:

1. A primary page, which contains basic information about myself

2. A resume page, which includes my relevant work and class experiences 

3. A personal page, which shares some fun things about myself

The website was originally configured to display through GitHub, but that functionality is not available in this portfolio. The website can be run locally via the server.js file if downloaded, however. As a visual aid, there is a youtube video which contains a walkthrough of the website.
